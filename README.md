# Exponential Profile – David Borrego

Hey there, Exponential team here. This document is a template for you to create the perfect Exponential showcase doc. We use this doc (among other things) to share your profile with partner startups. Feel free to tweak and make your own, this is just our base recommendation. You can check out a full example here.

⚠️ Important: in order for the doc to automatically show up in your [signal.goexponential.org](https://signal.goexponential.org) profile page, you must place it in a `README.md` file under a repo called `exponential` within your Github profile.

**Best with:** TypeScript · Python · FastAPI · Selenium  
**Familiar with:** React · Playwright · PostgreSQL · Bash

## 💡 TL;DR

I'm a software engineer with a background in AI and cybersecurity, building agent-based systems for autonomous pentesting and code analysis. My superpower is rapidly turning abstract product ideas into real, working prototypes in days. I recently launched **Unagi**, an AI-powered web security agent that simulates real users to uncover vulnerabilities—targeted at early-stage founders and indie devs. My drive is turning complex tech into accessible tools for people who build fast.

## About David Borrego

I'm an electronics engineer turned software engineer, currently finishing a Master’s in Software Engineering. I spent 2.5 years building computer vision systems in Barcelona, and recently moved to Madrid to launch my startup. I'm focused on building AI agents that secure web apps without user friction—merging generative AI with real browser automation. I'm especially excited by the intersection of generative coding and cybersecurity.

## Main Achievements

- 🚀 Launched [Unagi](https://unagi-tech.com), an AI-driven DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) agent platform that automates pentesting and code analysis.
- 🔬 Built a custom FastAPI + Selenium framework that navigates and analyzes any web app for security flaws—integrated with GitHub and file uploads.
- 📈 Went from idea to live product in under 6 weeks, including full backend, frontend, auth, and product strategy.
- 🤖 Created multi-agent architecture that detects login walls and delegates login flow resolution dynamically, without user intervention.

## How I Work

**Gets me pumped:**  
⚡ Building fast, shipping faster. Automating the boring stuff. Turning obscure tech into something non-technical users can touch.

**Disappoints me:**  
🧱 Corporate drag, too many meetings, or shallow tech with flashy slides.

**Strengths:**  
🛠️ Rapid prototyping, AI + browser automation, full-stack dev, product intuition.

**Improvement points:**  
🧭 Delegating early. I tend to solo too much when building fast.

**Known behaviours / comms style:**  
🧠 Direct, async-first, and honest. Prefer GitHub Issues + Notion over Slack noise.

## Other

**Hobbies / outlets:**  
🧘 Senderismo, cine, electrónica DIY. Me gusta descubrir nuevas ciudades.

**Values / worldview:**  
🚀 Alta velocidad, alto impacto. El software tiene que servir a las personas, no al revés.

**Fun facts:**  
📸 Mi primer sistema de visión fue una app que contaba objetos en tiempo real en la cocina de mi abuela.

## My Vision

I'm applying to Exponential to build a scalable, AI-native cybersecurity company. In 5 years, I see myself running a team that helps indie makers and startups ship safer products without needing to be experts in security. The U.S. is key for this: it’s where the builders are, and where the need for secure AI-native products will explode. I want Unagi to be the Postman of security.
